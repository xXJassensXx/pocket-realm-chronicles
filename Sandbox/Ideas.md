## General Idea:
In a world where being born with magic is normal, a man lives that has no such abilities. For his whole life, he was bullied and tormented as someone who didn't even manage to be born right. Without magic, he did not fit in anywhere and the fact that he wasn't a good swordsman either only made things worse. This however, did not discourage him from trying to prove everyone wrong. He had a clear goal in mind -Become an adventurer that goes in to History-.
Luckily he was not all alone. There is one Person that always supported and protected him. Her name was -Enter her name here- and together, they embarked on a journey to concur the 12 Dungeons of the world. It is said that the dungeons hold the secrets to immortality and near godhood. However they are also home to the nastiest beasts and environments this world has to offer. In the total documented history not a single adventuring party managed to clear even one dungeon. But -Name- and -Name- are determined to do it anyway. 

Sadly, after just three months, tragedy struck while trying to clear the 7th floor of the -Enter Dungeon Name Here-. The 7th floor was notorious for its difficulty; even experienced groups rarely managed to pass it. But this did not hold the duo back. After wandering the floor for a while, a -Enter Monster here- attacked. At first, things seemed fine, as they landed attack after attack on the creature. But in a desperate last strike, the monster hit -her name-, and she died protecting -his name-. She had been the only one by his side since they first met, never looking at him with disgrace or pity. She respected his bravery and acknowledged his effort to become someone great. She used to say, _“Fighting when you are strong is easy, but fighting when you know you are weak is what truly sets you apart.”_

Even though the monster was heavily wounded after a barrage of their attacks, -his name- had no chance of defeating it alone. Holding her lifeless body, he froze, paralyzed by shock and grief. His limbs would not obey, his heart ached, and despair consumed him. Then, in that instant, the ground beneath him split open. A brilliant light poured forth, and before he could comprehend it, the two of them were thrown into a completely different world.
