I’m not sure how to begin.  
Maybe that’s why I’ve been sitting here for almost an hour, staring at a blank page while the ink dries in the bottle.  
[[Sarah]] would laugh at me for that. She always said I overthink everything.

But this is for her.  
For all of you, really.  
So… I suppose I should start at the beginning.
Before everything went downhill.
Before my world collapsed.
Before you died, [[Sarah]].

I was born without an ability, in a world where everyone has one. There had never been anyone like me before, and yet… there I was.
An ability defines a person, who they are, who they’ll become, where they belong.
Without one, I belonged nowhere.
People looked at me with this strange mix of pity and discomfort, as if my very existence unsettled them. Most wouldn’t even meet my eyes. I had just turned seven, when my parents, terrified of loosing their reputation, threw me out. Three days after the ceremony that reveals your ability, they simply left me on the street and never returned. Naturally, the guards found me, and I ended up in the orphanage. I've lived there ever since. 

This is when i met her.
[[Sarah]].
She was a year younger than me, brought in after losing her parents in a robbery gone wrong. We bonded quickly, two children with nowhere to go, no place to return to, and nothing left but each other. She was the only one who saw me for who I am, not for the power I hold. Some time passed. It was probably the happiest period of my life, just being with her, living freely, and feeling truly happy. Then she turned seven, and her ability was revealed. She had been blessed with one of the rarest powers in existence, a gift usually reserved for nobles. Her ability, Dragon’s Fang, enhanced any sword she wielded, allowing it to strike monsters with devastating force. She told me that people expected great things from her, and that she would be leaving the orphanage to live and train at the knights’ barracks. I was happy for her, since she had been blessed with such a powerful ability, but I was also sad that she had to leave me behind, to become someone I could never be.

But then I thought: “No! I will not let others or an ability decide who I am supposed to be, or who I can and cannot become!”

In that moment, I made a promise to her that we would train and become adventurers together, leaving our mark on history side by side.

More time passed, and we trained rigorously to become adventurers. She was always ahead of me in almost every regard, but that only encouraged me to push myself even harder. When I turned eighteen, it was finally time to start fulfilling our promise.

Together, we formed an adventurer duo and planned how we would leave our mark on history. Our goal was audacious: to clear one of the twelve world dungeons. These dungeons were notorious for their difficulty, and even experienced adventurer parties struggled to complete the first floor. No party had ever managed to fully clear a dungeon, but we were determined to be the first.

Not long after that, we prepared to leave our home village and make our way to the closest world dungeon. Many people wished [[Sarah]] good luck or told her not to go. Whereas for me, they seemed glad that I was finally leaving this place.

Three months later, we arrived in the town closest to the dungeon. Many adventurers lived there, hoping to try their luck at clearing it. We bought some equipment and maps of the dungeon at the local market. Most shopkeepers warned us not to venture too deep into the dungeon, as it had been the end of hundreds of adventuring parties. We always said that we would be careful, but in hindsight, we should have listened to their advice.

At first, things went well. We cleared the first two floors with relative ease, gaining confidence with each success. The thrill of progress made the dangers feel smaller, and we began to believe our dream of making history was within reach.

But the next floors tested us in ways we hadn’t anticipated. We barely survived some encounters, our bodies and minds pushed to the limit. We should have stopped there, but the thought of being the first to clear a world dungeon drove us onward. That was our mistake.

On the seventh floor, we encountered a monster far stronger than anything we had faced. No, it wasn’t just strong. It was impossible for me to handle. I was holding her back. And then, as the creature’s claw came toward me, she leapt in front of me to save me.

As she lay in my arms, memories of our years together crashed through my mind all at once. She had been the only one who ever saw me for who I truly am, not for the ability I possessed or the lack of one. She was my home, my hope, my future… and in that moment, she died.

Her limp body collapsed against me as we fell to the floor. The monster screamed, its voice echoing through the chamber, preparing its next attack. But I couldn’t hear it. My own injuries burned, yet I couldn’t feel them. I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed, numbed by the shock of losing her.

The monster leaped forward, its claw just inches away from ending my life as well. But then, out of nowhere, a bright glow formed beneath me. The world around me blurred. Before the killing strike landed, the floor vanished…

…and suddenly, we fell into an entirely different world.
