I didn’t feel the ground beneath me, only her weight in my arms. 
Am I dead? 
No… she saved me. And now, looking at her body, reality hit. 
No. No. No! This can’t be how it ends!
Tears stung my eyes. “Please… don’t leave me alone.” 
I shook her gently, but it was already too late. 
I sat there, holding her, and cried.

This place was strange. An endless, still ocean stretched in every direction.  
The sky was an unnatural, perfect blue. No clouds. No sun. Yet everything was lit.  
The air didn’t move. And worst of all: silence. Absolute, deafening silence.  
I could hear only my own ragged breaths between heartbeats.

“I can’t… I can’t be alone again,” I whispered, my voice cracking.  
“I just… I don’t want to be alone anymore.”

The still ocean beneath me shimmered slightly, as if it had caught a pulse of my voice.  
The silence stretched, heavy and unbroken… and then, faintly, I heard it.  
A voice. Not mine.

"Who is there?" I asked, my voice shaking.  
"I… I don't know," the voice replied, soft and uncertain.

It was a girl's voice. Somewhere familiar, and yet not.  
I froze. This… this wasn't possible.

"Where are you?" I asked, my voice echoing over the ocean.  
"I… I'm here," she replied, as if not quite sure.

Her voice seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.
I stood up, laying [[Sarah|Sarah's]] body on the water. 
"I don't feel any pain" I realized, amazed that all my wounds had healed.

"I can't see you," I said, as the ocean shimmered again beneath my feet.

Ripples spread across the surface, and a faint mist began to curl over the water like smoke.  
It twisted, swirled, and slowly took on a vaguely humanoid shape.

The mist thickened and solidified, forming a body slightly smaller than mine.  
She looked younger, maybe fifteen, with long white hair and eyes as blue as the endless sky.

"I'm here," she said, more certain this time.

I blinked, unable to move, my heart hammering in my chest.
The mist had solidified completely now.

"Did she just materialize from thin air?" I muttered in disbelief, not realizing that she could hear every word.

"I think so." she replied, her soft voice and uncertain, still trying to make sense of what had just happened.

Trying not to stare too much, I asked, "What's your name?"
"I don't have a name," she replied, a slight frown crossing her face.

"Hmm… would you like me to give you one?" I offered, trying to cheer her up.

She looked at me, eyes widening. "A name… for me?"
There was confusion in her voice, but also a fragile kind of happiness, as if she wasn't sure she deserved one.

"Sure," I said softly. "Everyone should have a name."

"What do you think of Ellie?"
She looked at me with a bright smile.

"What a wonderful name. From now on, you can call me [[Ellie]]."

I couldn’t help smiling back.
"Nice to meet you, [[Ellie]]. My name is [[Lucien]]."

"Who is this?" [[Ellie]] asked softly, pointing at [[Sarah||Sarah’s]] body.

"This is my companion," I said, my voice trembling. "She saved my life before I ended up in this place… and she was killed because I was too weak."
I swallowed hard, trying not to break down again.

"Oh… I'm sorry," she said, realizing how much the topic hurt me.

There was a short pause before she asked, her voice full of curiosity,
"What is this place?"

"I hoped you could answer that," I replied, unable to hide a hint of disappointment.

She looked down, thinking hard.
"All I can remember is a faint voice… full of guilt and grief. I can’t recall what it said, but shortly after that, I remember talking to you."
Her brows furrowed as she tried to piece her memories together.

"So you don't have any memories of the other world?" I asked.

"Other world?" she repeated, tilting her head, clearly not understanding what I meant.

"I mean… the place you came from. Before you ended up here," I explained, trying to keep my voice steady.

[[Ellie]] hesitated.
"I… don't know," she said slowly. "I have no memories of another world. It's like… I've always been here."

"What is this other world like?" [[Ellie]] asked.

"Well, for people like me, its a harsh place," I answered, "You see, in this world your ability defines your worth and I'm the only one that has no ability."
